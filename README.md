# Project: Connecting Nginx Server in Linux and Windows IIS Server with Load Balancer on Azure

This project demonstrates the setup and configuration of a load balancer on Azure to distribute traffic between an Nginx server running on Linux and a Windows IIS server. The load balancer helps improve the availability and scalability of the application by evenly distributing incoming requests.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to showcase the following:

- Setting up a Linux server with Nginx to serve web content.
- Configuring a Windows IIS server to host a web application.
- Creating a load balancer on Azure to distribute incoming traffic.
- Ensuring high availability and scalability of the application.

## Technologies Used

- Azure Cloud Platform
- Nginx
- Linux
- Windows IIS Server

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- An Azure account with sufficient permissions to create resources.
- Access to a Linux server and a Windows IIS server.
- Basic knowledge of Linux, Nginx, and Windows IIS server administration.

## Setup Instructions

1. Provision a Linux server and install Nginx.
2. Configure Nginx to serve web content on the Linux server.
3. Provision a Windows IIS server and install the necessary web application.
4. Test the Linux server and Windows IIS server individually to ensure they are working correctly.
5. Create a load balancer on Azure and configure it to distribute traffic between the Linux and Windows IIS servers.
6. Test the load balancer by accessing the application through the load balancer's public IP.
